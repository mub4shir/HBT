            “It was clean and well maintained. Buses and entertainment with
            walking distance. The staff at check in and check out were friendly
            and helpful. Had a laid back casual atmosphere, a nice break from
            the constant acts on the strip.”

            fact that there is a swimming pool and security to keep the people
            safe. I also like the fact that it is walking distance from the bus
            stop. And Tamra the manager was amazing.”
